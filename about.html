        <p>There were many reasons behind choosing this particular topic for the survey. As students, we face many problems in our curriculum anyways, and the COVID-19 situation has not helped to make it better.
            So, this survey focuses on the questions that might help the management understand the mindset of the current students. Which can ultimately lead them to make better decisions about their courses.
